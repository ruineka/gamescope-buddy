# gamescope-buddy
A gamescope-session configuration tool


### WIP
This is going to be a tool that can be used with https://github.com/chimeraos/gamescope-session.git that will allow you to set the `GAMESCOPECMD` configuration to make it easy to rotate the screen, set cursor images, set Steam splash screen, and more.
